# Overview
The DSLs allows for a simplified, but still powerful, access to our data. It also abstracts the backend allowing for changes with low impact on the clients.  

There are 3 kinds of DSL. One for defining how to [query](./query_dsl.md) the data, one for defining how to [transform](./transforms_dsl.md) the existing fields and one for defining how to [create](./runtime_dsl.md) new fields at runtime (during the request).
